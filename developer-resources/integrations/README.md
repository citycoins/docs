# Integrations

CityCoins are built on top of [the Stacks blockchain](https://stacks.co), with several options for integrating depending on the use case.

Since CityCoins are powered by Stacks, the options range from running a Stacks node to creating smart contracts or applications that interact with the CityCoins protocol.

For inspiration check out the [CityCoins blog](https://citycoins.co/blog) which highlights the ethos of the community and the [CityCoins Wiki](https://citycoins.wiki), both of which celebrate the successes of builders and community members working together toward a CityCoins future.
