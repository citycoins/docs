# Introduction

Welcome, we're glad you found us! CityCoins are powered by [Stacks](https://stacks.co), a blockchain that enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.

CityCoins have two main functions: **Mining** and **Stacking**.

* Anyone can compete to mine CityCoins by forwarding STX into a CityCoin smart contract.
* 30% of the STX spent by miners is automatically forwarded to a reserved wallet for the city
* 70% of the STX spent by miners is rewarded to Stackers, who lock their CityCoin in the contract for a number of reward cycles

CityCoins are also **programmable** using [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org), the language that powers smart contracts on Stacks.

This opens up endless possibilities for their utility, and new opportunities for developers, entrepreneurs, residents, and more.
