# Introduction

Welcome, we're glad you found us! CityCoins are powered by [Stacks](https://stacks.co), a blockchain that enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.

CityCoins have three main functions: **Activation**, **Mining**, and **Stacking**.

* **Activation:** CityCoins only exist through mining, which does not begin until 20 independent wallets signal activation after the contract is deployed. No ICO, no pre-sale, no pre-mine.
* **Mining:** Anyone can mine CityCoins by forwarding STX into a CityCoins smart contract on the Stacks blockchain. 30% of the STX that miners forward is sent directly to a reserved wallet for the city.
* **Stacking:** Anyone can Stack CityCoins by locking them in a CityCoins smart contract for determined reward cycles, and recieve a portion of the remaining 70% of the STX sent by miners.

CityCoins are also **programmable using **[**Clarity**](https://clarity-lang.org), the language that powers smart contracts on Stacks.

This opens up endless possibilities for their utility, and new opportunities for developers, entrepreneurs, residents, and more.
