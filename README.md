# Introduction

Welcome, we're glad you found us! CityCoins are powered by [Stacks](https://stacks.co), a blockchain that enables smart contracts on the Bitcoin network.

CityCoins have four main features: **Activation**, **Mining**, **Stacking,** and **Programming.**

* [**Activation:**](core-protocol/registration-and-activation.md) CityCoins only exist through mining, which does not begin until 20 independent wallets signal activation after the contract is deployed. No ICO, no pre-sale, no pre-mine.
* [**Mining:**](core-protocol/mining-citycoins.md) Anyone can mine CityCoins by submitting STX into a CityCoins smart contract on the Stacks blockchain. 30% of the STX that miners forward is sent directly to a reserved wallet for the city.
* [**Stacking:**](core-protocol/stacking-citycoins.md) Anyone can Stack CityCoins by locking them in a CityCoins smart contract for selected reward cycles, and receive a portion of the remaining 70% of the STX sent by miners.
* [**Programming:**](developer-resources/general.md) using [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org), the language that powers smart contracts on Stacks, CityCoins open up endless possibilities for utility, including new opportunities for developers, entrepreneurs, residents, and more.
