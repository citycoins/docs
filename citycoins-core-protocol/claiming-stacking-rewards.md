# Claiming Stacking Rewards

## Overview

While Stacking CityCoins is similar to Stacking STX, there are a few key differences.

Instead of rewards being delivered automatically during the cycle, Stackers must wait for the **number of chosen reward cycles to pass** before claiming their Stacking rewards, which consist of:

* the amount of MiamiCoins they Stacked
* the Stacks \(STX\) sent by miners

Each Stacker receives rewards proportionate to what they stacked against the total amount of Stacked CityCoins for the given reward cycle.
