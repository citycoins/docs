# Claiming Mining Rewards

## Overview

Miners must wait for a maturity window of 100 blocks \(~16 hours\) before they can claim their tokens in order to protect the VRF seed. After this window passes miners can claim their rewards at any time.  
  
‚Äç**Please note:** CityCoins are not minted until miners claim them, and therefore the total supply will only increase when miners claim their CityCoins.
