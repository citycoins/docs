# Activation of Mining

The launch of a CityCoin happens in a two-step process:

1. The contract for a CityCoin is deployed to the Stacks blockchain
2. 20 unique wallets send a transaction to the contract signaling activation

Once the threshold is met, a 150 block \(~24hr\) countdown begins after which anyone is eligible to mine the CityCoins within a given Stacks block.

There are no CityCoins issued or distributed prior to the start of mining.
