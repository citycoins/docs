# How do I get started?

## **Stacks Web Wallet**

The [Stacks Web Wallet](https://hiro.so/wallet/install-web) is required to interact with a CityCoin smart contract on the Stacks blockchain.  
  
It is a browser extension available for both Chrome and Firefox, and at this time mobile is not supported - use a desktop or laptop!  
  
In addition, each of the contract functions require sending a transaction to the smart contract, with transaction fees paid in Stacks \(STX\).

## **How to Acquire Stacks \(STX\)**

As mentioned above, all transactions with CityCoins require Stacks \(STX\) as fuel.  
  
To acquire Stacks, please see the [market list on CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/markets/) for supported exchanges.

## **How to Hodl CityCoins**

All CityCoins are fungible tokens on the Stacks blockchain, meaning they are stored, displayed, and used in the Stacks Web Wallet. An example screenshot from testnet is below:
