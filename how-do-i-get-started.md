# How do I get started?

## **Stacks Web Wallet**

The [Stacks Web Wallet](https://hiro.so/wallet/install-web) is required to interact with a CityCoin smart contract on the Stacks blockchain.\
\
It is a browser extension available for both Chrome and Firefox, and at this time mobile is not supported - use a desktop or laptop!\
\
In addition, each of the contract functions require sending a transaction to the smart contract, with transaction fees paid in Stacks (STX).

## **How to Acquire Stacks (STX)**

As mentioned above, all transactions with CityCoins require Stacks (STX) as fuel.\
\
To acquire Stacks, please see the [market list on CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/markets/) for supported exchanges.

## **How to HODL CityCoins**

All CityCoins are fungible tokens on the Stacks blockchain, meaning they are stored as part of your Stacks account and viewable on the Explorer.

The [Stacks Web Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet/install-web) allows you to view your balance, send and receive CityCoins, and interact with smart contracts.
