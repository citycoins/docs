# How do I get started?

## Stacks **Wallets**

CityCoins follow the [SIP-010 fungible token standard](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md) on the Stacks blockchain, which is a fancy way of saying you'll need a Stacks wallet to interact with them.

The currently supported wallets for CityCoins are listed below.
