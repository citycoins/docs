# How do I get started?

## Stacks **Wallets**

CityCoins follow the [SIP-010 fungible token standard](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md) on the Stacks blockchain, which is a fancy way of saying you'll need a Stacks wallet to interact with them.

The currently supported wallets for CityCoins are listed below.

## **How to Acquire Stacks (STX)**

All transactions on the Stacks blockchain require Stacks (STX) as fuel.\
\
To acquire Stacks, please see the [market list on CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/markets/) for supported exchanges.

## **How to HODL CityCoins**

All CityCoins are fungible tokens on Stacks, meaning they are stored as part of your Stacks account and viewable in the [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.co) by searching for your Stacks address.

{% hint style="info" %}
When sending or receiving CityCoins, use the Stacks address of the sender and recipient. A memo is generally only required when transferring to an exchange.
